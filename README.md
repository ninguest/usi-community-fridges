# usi-community-fridges
Community fridges are grassroots mutual aid initiatives that provide food access to people in need. However, thereâ€™s currently no structured system for locating these fridges, matching donations to fridge managers, or measuring impact. How might we scale the initiative while ensuring sustainability and accessibility?
